# Gameplay
Use the keywords or WASD to move PI and evade the *sin* attacks from the *engeneers*. Jump in their heads to disable them for a while. 

If you are stuck try to pass through a *cos* and invert the gravity, this can open another ways to pass the level ( *this don't affect your controllers, i.e. if you're with inverted gravity and press UP you will jump from ceiling to floor* ).

One way platforms ( the thinner ones ) can be crossed only from bottom to above, but you can press and hold DOWN to descend them.

Pass through the checkpoint poles to save your progress in a level. After dying you will respwan at the last checkpoint mark.
#### Boss Fight
After finishing a level you will face TAU. He has two shields of spike balls and will move trying to kill you. Try to survive and hit him in the head (between the eyes) when an opening in his defense appears . Succeeding in attacking three times and the victory is yours!

# Notes

The game was developed for a presentation, don't expect great effects and nice designed levels, but expect to face a challenge.
